# deep_reasoning
A novel approach to create an AI tool that can achieve two main goals - capable of reasoning more reliably and generate new ideas to solve truly new problems.


# Idea: Reasoning, Creativity and Analogy [Work in Progress]

The proposed concept rests on the premise that both reasoning and creativity are forms of analogy finding. Reasoning, particularly evident in mathematical truths, involves applying known rules to new entities.

Creativity, on the other hand, can be viewed as analogy finding with relaxed constraints. It allows for the application of known patterns in one domain to another, often breaking some existing rules. This violation of rules or assumptions leads to innovative thinking and novel solutions, although not all creative ideas will be valid or useful.

Both reasoning and creativity uses analogy as the underlying common process to create and validate new and existing ideas. Finding analogy can be translated into a well known problem in Graph Theory - called Graph Isomorphism. If we map concepts to nodes and relationship among concepts as edges, we can transform a piece of fact or knowledge into a graph. Although this is not a new approach, the idea of using graph isomorphism to detect patterns of reasoning is new. 

Converting text or input training data into graphs will be the first major task for this project. We will also need an effcient algorithm to find isomorphism. These graphs will be represented via set of embedding vectors in a continuous vector space, instead of the traditional discrete nodes and edge based graphs.
